            <h2>System Design</h2>

            <p> The entire application uses nothing but vanilla javascript,html, and the tools provided by our browser.
                we are using different canvases to layer different interactive layers and create our AR application.
                It may seem that there are 3 canvases (or "windows") on our screen but there are actually 5. our largest
                canvas element is actually 3 canvases layed on top of each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                the bottom-layer canvas, canvasA, is where we send the image data from our camera. our application will
                update the image of canvasA with the image Data supplied by our camera every 30 miliseconds.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next layer (the middle layer) is the piano layer. It is where we display and draw the
                piano keys that our users will interact with. Unlike more common javascript strategies, we can NOT
                assign individual eventListeners to things we draw on our canvas element. This means I cannot express
                functions as a result of the typical javascript event listener method, because javascript cannot
                interpret
                these canvas images as buttons. this presents a problem that requires some creativity to solve.
            </p>

            <p>
                we solve this issue of interactivity through the creation of our hit-canvas, the
                upper-right window. If we hover over the main window with our mouse, we will see that we have a small
                circle that follows our movement on the hit-canvas. that is our relative mouse-location of our main
                canvas being applied
                to our hit canvas.
                so, we create a function that detects if the pixel that our mouse location is hovering over
                matches a color of one of our buttons in the hit-canvas. if it is a match, we will trigger callback
                functions.
                similarly, if we detect a click and the relative position of our mouse is on the color of a button on
                our hit canvas,
                we can program proper responses for that particular button. this is how we are able to solve the issue
                of interacting with our piano without being able to apply
                traditional javascript eventListeners directly to drawn buttons of our canvas.
            </p>

            <p>

                The explanation of our middle layer explains how we manage mouse events, but how are we able to trigger
                appropriate functions with our camera? This takes us to the heart of our application, which is visual
                hit detection. This app requires a "beginning" image. it is called our background image and we can set
                it by clicking the bottom-right canvas.
                we are able to detect hits by comparing the differences between the images being streamed to canvasA and
                the background image we stored.
            </p>

            <p>
                In all the places of the image where there is not a match, we can draw those non-matching pixels onto
                our top-most
                canvas. This is especially important because, it allows our finger to appear on top of a button.
                remember that our piano keys are drawn on TOP of our camera stream canvas. So, even if we hovered our
                finger over the buttons, it would still appear behind the buttons, so doing it this way, allows the user
                to more intuitively operate the application. our hit-pixels are also expressed in our hit-canvas, as you
                can observe. When a difference in visual composition is detected over a button, we will trigger
                the appropriate responses, which in this case, is to play a sound, and highlight the button red.

        <!-- <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="explain">The magic here, is that through modular programming, I created a working button system for my canvas.
            This might seem exceedingly simple, but this is because html already has an in-place button system that is super intutive and built very well to work with javascript.
            However, HTML Canvas does not have such a system in place. if I want to display working interactive buttons, I have to create my button system through javascript.<br>
            <br>
            This particular system is able to recognize buttons by comparing the color of the pixel that my my cursor is hovering over, to the background color of my canvases; In this case white.
            as you move your cursor, if you are on a non-white space, the cursor changes into an index hand pointer. This gives an important clue to the user as well, that these areas are for their interaction.<br>
            If you click on a button, and the color isn't white, it will display that color onto Canvas C.
            <br><br>
            Now as a developer, what is truly useful, is that through only altering my simple top-function called main(), you can make,alter, and apply any kind of button onto any canvas and in any location inside each of the canvases.
            Through modular programming, we create functions to use as tools to let us automate the making and placing of working buttons. I don't have to draw every single button from scratch each time.
            I am able to plug in a few key values, and produce exceptionally different results. Any other developer you work with will find it infinitely more easy to undertand how your program works, than if
            you were to manually hard-code each and every button in a big jumbled mess of repetitive lines of code for each button</p>>
